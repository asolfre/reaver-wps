<h1><a name="Reaver_Open_Source"></a>Reaver Open Source<a href="#Reaver_Open_Source" class="section_anchor"></a></h1><p>Reaver implements a brute force attack against Wifi Protected Setup (WPS) registrar PINs in order to recover WPA/WPA2 passphrases, as described in <a href="http://sviehb.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/viehboeck_wps.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://sviehb.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/viehboeck_wps.pdf</a>. </p><p>Reaver has been designed to be a robust and practical attack against WPS, and has been tested against a wide variety of access points and WPS implementations.  </p><p>On average Reaver will recover the target AP&#x27;s plain text WPA/WPA2 passphrase in 4-10 hours, depending on the AP. In practice, it will generally take half this time to guess the correct WPS pin and recover the passphrase. </p><h1><a name="Reaver_Pro"></a>Reaver Pro<a href="#Reaver_Pro" class="section_anchor"></a></h1><p>Intimidated by the command-line? Running Windows, OS X, or just don&#x27;t want to run Linux, download, and compile the open source Reaver?  </p><p><strong><a href="http://www.reaversystems.com" rel="nofollow">Reaver Pro is $75.00!</a></strong> </p><p>Reaver Pro is a compact embedded device customized for Reaver attacks and WEP cracking. No more driver compatibility issues. It just works! </p><p>Reaver Pro Features: <ul><li>New easy to use GUI </li><li>Optimized PIN sequencing using Markov Chains based on on PINs from hundreds of actual WPS-enabled devices </li><li>Integrated WEP cracking </li></ul></p>
